# UFC Data Analysis

The following is an analysis of a dataset concerning historical UFC matches. It serves as a tutorial for exploratory data analysis in Pandas and introductory machine learning
using models from Scikit-learn.

- /UFC Data contains the actual datasets themselves, downloaded from Kaggle.

- /Reference Data contains some helper datasets that are useful for specific data transformations.

- UFC_Analysis.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook itself, which runs through the entire data analysis tutorial.

The tutorial as a whole can also be found on my website at https://rkasugan.com/UFC-Data-Analysis/

Happy reading!
